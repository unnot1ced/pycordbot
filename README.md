# Pycordbot :D

An awesome Python bot that can do some cool tasks! Created just for fun and learning - not meant to be a big server bot :)

## What's This About? :)

This is a fun little Discord bot I made using the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library! It shows you how to:
- Get your bot connected to Discord servers
- Make it reply to messages - it's so cool when it works!
- Set up commands with a prefix - super handy :p

Great for learning and playing around with - build something even cooler on top of it!

## Cool Stuff :D

### DIY Setup :p

#### What You'll Need

- Python 3.10 or newer
- The awesome `discord.py` library
- A bot token from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) - it's free!

#### Let's Do This! :D

1. Grab the code:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/unnot1ced/pycordbot.git
   cd DiscordBotTest
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (totally recommended!):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Get those packages installed:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add your secret token:
   ```sh
   # Make a .env file with your super secret token :p
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
   ```

5. Fire it up! :D
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Playing With Your Bot :)

Once it's running:

- Say `!hello` and watch it say hi back! So friendly! :D
- Try `!help` to see all the cool commands it knows! I'm adding more all the time :)

## Need Help? :)
